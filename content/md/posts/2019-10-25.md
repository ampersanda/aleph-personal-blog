## `The End of Yesterday : 08:00` 
We are going to home of the yesterday's overtime. We (me and Aulia) is feeling unwell at the time, I think because of unexpected overtime.

## `The Another Start : 13.00`
I think this day will be a long one, the project is still going until the end of the day.

## `The Another End : 21.00`
This is new experience of me, as a new person in team that do overtime job. Nobody wants it, The Experience wants us to try.
