## **Status : Normal**
## **Start : 09:00**
Like I said, I'll be auditing icon font for this Cordon Bleu project because many of them are unordered and not added yet in the list.
After friday praying, me and the team would talk about missed components we haven't created yet.

## **Happy weekend : 18:00**
Some of Aleph friends invite me and Dika to join them hangout, but I decided to cancel that.
My laziness is much stronger that anything. Haha.
