This is my first day working in Aleph Labs. To be honest I don't know what to expect.
I have nobody in Aleph, I don't know one person inside.

## **Status: NORMAL**

## **The Beginning of All : 10:30**
Angela greeted us and made us meet every person in the office. It's pretty quiet office, but they said that people are assigned to projects that require them to be on the site of client.
That makes sense.  

Yay, I make new friend. His name is `Joshua`. He's React Native developer. Currently we are in the same state of new here.

Devices are given to us to support our work. I retrieved MacBook Air on my hand, some note stuff and candy. We still don't have work to do so I'd say it's fine to use MacBook Air to do programming stuff.

I started to setup the MacBook.

## **Lunchtime!**
`Pakpid` and `Tumtum` invited us to lunch together at kind of cafeteria inside the building of `K-Link Tower`. We have some _chit-chat_ about experiences in development.

## **Post Lunch until 19:00**
`Pakpid` told me that `BCA Bleu project` is coming and for the good, it's using `Vue.js`, yayy!!.
I can't really wait for it. And it uses Atomic Design which I don't really ever do, but I know some of it.

I learn some of it after.
