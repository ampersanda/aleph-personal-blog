## **Status: Normal**
I'm still sick, even it's been a whole day I took rest.

## **Start : 09:00**
Some code that I wrote doesn't compatible in IE 9, obviously, I don't expect to write code for that "that" requirement.

It's not about the styling actually, I wrote my code, my major code, in modern way, including my JavaScript.

And also, SiemaJS doesn't support IE9. Hmmmm..

So I assigned myself first to day to fix some of layout, or relayouting, from using CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox to something that can be replace them, in an old fashion way.

I've done some small tasks, then I should rewrite carousels code of **Smart Tile** and **Smart Search**. 

## **End : 18:00**
This day was a slow progress of me, I couldn't think clearly. I am sorry.
