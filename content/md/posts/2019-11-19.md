## **Status : Normal**
## **Blocker : I need MacBook Pro (I guess)**

## **Start : 09:00**
Finishing *Live Banner* by adding autoplay indicator in the dots. Actually I did it using SiemaJS before, I guess deleting and refactoring some code is okay.

and I did add some icons from Zeplin. Makes me take a deep breath, because *beach ball of death* (I mean laptop that I use is lagging) is thrown to me.

I've done some small tasks today like fixing things, adding *text icon* and *icon with description* atom, not big ones.

## **End : 18:00**
I will be stay still on this project to get the second sprint done.
