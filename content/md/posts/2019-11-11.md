Little bit late to start today. Feeling ill since Saturday.

Explained some refactoring concept for SmartBar today to Mr. Fachri, change existing code to simple one.

I did add autoplay for Smart Tile, the thing that I missed yesterday, and I also combined some of components to make header section one.

Mr. Fachri said that tomorrow we will meet up for discussing the next sprint.

## **Finish Up : 18:00**
I am still feeling sick, so I don't really know what to expect for tomorrow.
