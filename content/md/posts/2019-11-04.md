Little bit late to office because of drivers rejecting, but that's okay, I guess.  

## **Status: NORMAL**

## **Start Working : 09:23**
I was taking **4 hours** of my weekend to get this (Sales Tools - XL Priority) project done with and today, **`to be gratefully, my mood is on fire`**, So I think I will get tasks done.

Some code still need to be merged with Aulia's code and some code conflicts happened. 
  
## **The Ending : 18:29** 

Conflicts are done. And I think this checkpoint has accomplished.
I hope positive feedback from client will be approach us tomorrow.

Thank you for today. ðŸ™‚
