## **Status : Normal** 

## **Start : 09:00** 

## **Confusing moment**
Peoples are in hurry to get to go out of the building. Fire alarm was ringing. I don't know that this fire drill is just a fake fire drill or not. 
Firefighters were coming and try to extinguish things (probably).

## **Back to work**
I did drag some cards to done today from `BCA Public Site`.

- [x] Fixing favicon disappeared because of branch merging
- [x] Remove rich transition of sidebar and use simpler animation based on anchor instead 

## **Extras**
We met everyone up especially developers. We introduced ourselves and got to know each other even we are not in the same project.
