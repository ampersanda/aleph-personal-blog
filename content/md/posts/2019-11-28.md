## **Status : Normal**
A little bit late today. Traffic jammed and filled buses. 

## **Start : 10:00**
New board was assigned to us. It comes from Mr. Fachri who had an idea to share project across developers from others project to gain (better) feedback.   

I did some task which currently some bug fixing and made some components.

In footer, links should be and `<a>` instead of `<p>`, so I made styling for them and changed it.
I also did create **"table view kurs list"** or `exchange-table` and move it to done section in board.

It seems that article page needs an extra padding to be matched with the design, so I did move that card to progress and then done.
