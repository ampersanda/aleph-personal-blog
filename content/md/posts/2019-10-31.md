It's another (third) day of `XL Priority Project` of us. Yes, us, me and Dika Mahardika.

Today it's a different traffic day. 
My GO-Jek driver has different route this morning. He said some road are blocked, He told me why but strong wind comes to my ear ðŸ˜….
**Little bit refreshing**, I think that I am grateful for today, hehe.

## `The Beginning : 09:00`
Move on to project. As it is, this project still makes me little sad. Fortunately Dika has already done his task so he can help me through this "experience".
So yesterday, I've done the `first of four` section of _Replacement_, so next challenge will be the `second part of it`. 

## `The Ending : 18:00`
And finally for the next day, I'll keep up with the second part of _Replacement_ section of this project.
