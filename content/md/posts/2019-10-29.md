New place, I'm coming!!!

Today we moved to **Co-Hive Coworking Space** in Sudirman Jakarta. Very excited about it, and also Go-Jek fare is only IDR 7.000 from boarding house. More excitement added to it, hehe.     

## `The New Beginning : 09:00`
To be fair, this morning I don't have any task to do, so I decided to move Medium and Dev.to post to [my personal blog.](https://ampersanda.dev) 

## `New Task is approaching!!!`
So today I assigned to new task called `The Revision of XL Priority Sales Tools project`. We (me and Dika) both assigned with two tasks, and we both split to it.

I assigned myself to `project-has-needed-to-be-done-not-very-soon` one. The first project that Dika assign himself, had to be done tomorrow at the end of the day. And mine will meet the deadline at Monday, next week, at the end of the day.

## `Getting started`
To be honest, after I looked into this code project `xl-prioitas-revamp`, my anger and my sadness come into one.
I don't really know how to describe it even to myself.

Shortly, the code is _broken_ (Yeah, I still don't know how to describe it well).

## `Keeping Up : 18:00`
My anger and sadness is relieved, not all of it but I'm glad. Same project is still one the line so I'll try to keep positive.
