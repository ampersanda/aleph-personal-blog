## **Status : Normal**

## **Start: 10:00**
Back to BCA again (for tomorrow) 🎉. I really liked involved in Mokita project, even though I couldn't help the team much and more.
When me in the team, I didn't really help them much. Like I said, I never really involved in React Native project.
I'd do my best.

This is little bit summary about what I did in Mokita project:   

- ✅ **UI/View/Component Side** -- I helped little bit in UI side.
- ❌ **API Integration** -- I tried to integrate one of the API to the app but I got confused by the project structure. sorry.
- ✅ **Sharing 🙃** 

## **End: 19:00**
