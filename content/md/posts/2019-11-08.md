## **Status: NORMAL**

Traffics are great.

## **It's a good morning : 09:00**
At this point, in the morning, auditing code when merging one with another branch is little bit need an extra, but it is fine.

### (Not) Really a problem  
Bunch of icons are not listed in design system catalog, so I need to check one by one of icons that really needed to be used in pages.

And at some point, Zeplin couldn't make things easier.

Yes, as you can see above, images are exported as a square, a blue square.


### Assign (myself) to the next task
For the next card to move to "Ongoing", I took the **Smart Tile** one for **Cordon Bleu** project.

It's pretty challenging. I like tweaking and creating things using JavaScript (the vanilla one), I know some of the code will be long as eel but at least I enjoyed the process and everything's done by the end of the day.

One spec that I forgot to add to this **Smart Tile** is __**autoplay**__ feature  

## **Last of first checkpoint! : 18:00**
Monday, I'll be merging branches and make the whole components to be one section of header page.
Wish me luck.
