## **Status : Normal**
I took TransJakarta today, for the first time. It's a nice bus to ride in.
*It's cheaper* than my daily GoJek ride.

## **Start : 09:00**
Merge the branches as usual. I had a problem with navigation bar, I don't really know which one to be pushed right into develop branch but I pushed mine instead, because it works well with sidebar and it's animation.
I did make simple article slider/carousel and adding some icon to Cordon Bleu icon font.

2 👏 components 👏 left 👏. 

## **End : 18:00**
I realize that **Smart Input** problem isn't solved yet in IE9, should fix it fast tomorrow.
The problem is IE9 doesn't have CSS `transition` and `opacity` (I could fallback this with `-ms-filter`).
Also, instead of using normal `transform`, it should be using the microsoft prefix one (`-ms-transform`);
