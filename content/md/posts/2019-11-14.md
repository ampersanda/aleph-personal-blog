## **Status: Alert**

## **Start : 09:00**
To be honest, IE9 makes everything to be written down as a undone checklist.

I fixed some of the problems like, JavaScript polyfills for event dispatcher and even Yahwin helped me at transforming vanilla `.forEach` to legacy `for`.

I had to remove all CSS variables and change it into SCSS' variable, and how unfortunate IE9 doesn't support CSS basic animation.
 Hmmmm..

I didn't test it all yet, because BrowserStack only let us run instance one at the time.

This also brought me a slow progress to achieve something to be create. I love create something, especially from scratch but IE9 really makes me, can I say "restricted"? 

## **End : 18:00**
One thing that I'm not done yet, is refactor carousel to Owl Carousel (?, maybe).

SiemaJS doesn't support IE9 (I'm not really surprised).
