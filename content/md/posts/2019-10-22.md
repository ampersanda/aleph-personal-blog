Second day, I still don't have work to do.

## `The Start (I think) : 10:00 - 19:00`
Let's jump to office. 

I never use toaster before, so I ask office boy how to use it, and I'm glad that I know how, hehe.  

I don't have work to do, so I practically use Atomic Design to build my personal blog. I tried to use Atomic and BEMCSS at the same time, it's kind of not promising.
Atomic design is weird in my personal preference.
