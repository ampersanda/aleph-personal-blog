It such a long trip to the office, it's almost take an hour ride. It's like, I don't know where my GO-Jek driver will bring me to.

He's driving really slow but this is not a safe one. I prefer to say, It's dangerous. He drives against the direction of where the traffic is.

## **Status: NORMAL**

## **Start Working : 09:00**
Still at the same project, `XL Priority Sales Tools` page. I still kind of have same problem with the code. We (me and Dika) sometimes break the old code but we have a trick to avoid that, using variants of the old code class name.

I know this sounds like too technical. 

Mr Fachri ask me how the project is going and all I can say is `not going well`.

## **Lunchtime**

I am happy that near CoHive, there's a vegetarian restaurant that I can eat. 
  
## **The Ending : 18:00** 

I'll code more later at boarding house.
