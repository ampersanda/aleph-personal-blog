## **Status : Alert**

## **Start : 09:30**
From what we discussing 2 days ago, I add some new cards to add performance checklist and re-setup the development environment.
Such as,
- [ ] Divide media queries styles (`mqpacker`)
- [ ] Optimize stylesheet by using additional separate CSS for IE9
- [ ] Remove SASS import duplication
- [ ] Use `picture` or `img` with `srcset` to embed image instead of standalone image for retina image and responsive purpose  

This project was set up using Brunch and pleeease which, made me confuse. `Stylesheets` and `JavaScripts` are compiled but why some of the brunch plugin config doesn't work at all.

I tried to investigate why I comes like that.
So, the problem is pleeease brunch doesn't recognized as a plugin by Brunch, I wrote the issue to the team and `pleeease-brunch`'s repository.
