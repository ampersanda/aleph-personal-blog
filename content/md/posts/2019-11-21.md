## **Status : Normal**
I slept well but I feel so sleepy today, I don't know why.

## **Start : 09:00**
Today I fixed some left behind fallback for IE9, like input `placeholder` property and `requestAnimationFrame` fallback which IE9 doesn't support.   

## **End : 18:00**
So far fallbacks and code alternative are done. I planned to audit icon font for tomorrow to add more icons to the library. The design system page in Zeplin doesn't provide additional icons library, so, yeah, maybe I'll do it by myself.
