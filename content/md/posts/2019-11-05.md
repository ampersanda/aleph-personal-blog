## `Status: NORMAL`

I forgot to commit additional task for XL Priority last night, I relieved that Mr. Fachri said that It is okay ðŸ™‚.

## `Start Working : 09:22`
Actually, this morning no task assigned to me, but after lunchtime Mr. Fachri would brief us about new project called `Cordon Bleu`. I don't what that naming means, but it's basically BCA site project

## `After Lunch - Before Brief`

Next week, I'll be one of speaker of DevFest Surabaya. It is kind of, I do't really know how to explain about that, but this is one of opportunity to become GDE (Google Developer Expert).
I've been talk and teach for some (not too big) of tech seminar and workshop, but this. Maybe this is a way through y dreams.

So, for your information, I'm one of GDG (Google Developer Group) Surabaya members in Surabaya until now. I think it's been almost two years I'm in the community, just helping little bit.

> I send them, Aleph Labs but I don't know why they write it down as "Aleph Studio" 

## `Still before brief`
Surprise, Surprise!!

Lead of GDG Surabaya sent me an offer about opportunity to be GDE Flutter, which I don't really know how to react.
  
I don't think that I'm ready yet, but they said that I should be ready to be one of them.
I think I'm okay writing in English but not about speaking.

## `BCA Project Brief`
Just us (Me, Yawin, and Mr. Fachri) discuss about how we develop this site. I also happy about this because, hey, this is a fresh project and I'm new in SMACSS and Atomic Design system. I used to be the BEMCSS guy (I like simplicity), this also new opportunity to me to learn new thing in styling the web. 
  
## `The Start of All : 18:22`
This is a great day ðŸ™ƒ and I don't want to miss THESE big opportunity.
