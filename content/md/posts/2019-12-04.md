## **Status : Normal**

## **Start : 10:00**
From problems that I faced yesterday, actually me and the team think discuss further about how this project going.
So I told HR about what's going on at this moment and asked how to us to solve these problems. 

We talked about some standarizations, performance, happiness and some of other possible problems about this project and/or this team.  

## **End : 19:00**
