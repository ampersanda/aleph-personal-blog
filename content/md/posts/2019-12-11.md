## **Status : Normal**

## **Start : 10:30**
Little bit late today. I didn't expect the bus travels that long from my boarding house to Karet Sudirman.

Today it's a new start for me, like I said I have no experiences developing React Native apps professionally.
Actually, I tried that for fun (and it's using [ClojureScript + Expo](https://github.com/ampersanda/journey-expo-cljs)) and it's just once a try.

Ilham gave (really) a simple task to me to create a `view` and simple API request using what provided in the project.
I was confused and asked things that I didn't how to do.

I was confused because so many files that this project have and I absolutely no idea where to start from, but I tried to search and read some code.

I expected that I did complete this task by end of this day, but it's not finished yet ðŸ˜­.

I hope I could learn more things about this. I (still) kept building the excitement about this new opportunity.

## **Christmas Vibes**
-- I will update this soon -- sorry.
