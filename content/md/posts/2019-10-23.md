So yesterday is not a really start of me to work. Maybe this day is.

## **Status: NORMAL** 

## **The Start (Actually it is) : 10:00** 
So I paired with this person, called Dika or Aulia, I choose Aulia, hehe.
He's pretty new also in this firm.

I assigned by Pak Muslih to help him to finish `XL Priority - Product(?) Section`.

So I code for the whole day.

## **The End of Day: 19:00**
I'm pretty grateful that I assigned to project, not about I have my job started but about how I also how others code.
