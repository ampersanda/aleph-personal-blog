## **Status : Normal** 

## **Start : 10:00**
So I was excited to get new device from Mr. Rahmad.
Whilst I was waiting for the brand new device, I learned some about React Native by watching YouTube videos.

I waited until around 2pm and surprisingly I got the new 2019 MacBook Pro. I was wowed.     

## **Astra Time ðŸ•ž**
When I came, almost everyone was jealous about MacBook that I use ðŸ˜‚. A task assigned for me while I kept up to learn React Native things.
I never professionally develop apps using React Native, but if I got a chance to learn, I'd take it.
