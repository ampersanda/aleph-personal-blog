## Unexpected thing
Suddenly my laptop (borrowed from Aleph) died in the middle of coding, no signal of turning on. 

Mr. Polin came to us and asked some questions about the project. Asking if we had a problem with the project and how we actually work in this.

## Unexpected thing (again)
The laptop, It's suddenly turning on by itself.
