## **Status : Normal**

## **Start : 09:00**
Because of this project is supporting IE9, I'm kinda doubt what the other old browser doing when this project is displayed.
So I cleanup and add some fallbacks inside SCSS files to (might be) support the other old browser.

Also, ESLint rules get ignored by other team member, We did  fix ESLint rules together.

Footer slide up and slide down effect using CSS Animation is kinda neat, but at some point it looks jaggy and it doesn't supported in IE9.
Fixed them by removing CSS and using built-in jQuery `slideUp` and `slideDown` function.     

And I created **"Event Date with result"** component.   

## **End : 18:00**
