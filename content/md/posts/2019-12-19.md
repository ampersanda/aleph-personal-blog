## **Status : Normal**
I don't really, lookup up what is going in this project, so I tried to see what's left.

## **Start: 10:00**
This morning, I started to at Trello boards and Pull Requests.
Aulia made a pull request about changing current Brunch to Gulp.
I'd happy to check about that and made some comments.

After that, I took a component card to make it done for today. 

## **End: 19:00**
