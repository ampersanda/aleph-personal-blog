## `Status: NORMAL`

Yesterday was rough, when I looked for drivers to go home, no drivers accept.
I was stuck at bus stop almost for one and a half hour, then I got one driver at 8 p.m.

Sadly, that trip charges me more because of Grab demands. It charges me for Rp. 150.000 to get to home/boarding house.  

## `Good Morning : 09:00`
Today, I was working on **Cordon Bleu** project. 

Got the **System Icon** task done, but had a pending task in **Visual Icon**, because no 7 of 8 icon assets I couldn't find is slice/assets tab.
I skipped it and moved on to **Smart Search** branch.

I wrote bunch of JavaScripts to build **Smart Search** component, most of that is got to work with suggestion walker event (the up and down arrow events).
 
## `Checkpoint! : 18:00`
It's raining again!
