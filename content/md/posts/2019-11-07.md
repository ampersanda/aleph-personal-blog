## **Status: NORMAL**

It's almost 2 hours trip to the office, the driver was kind of mad, and I'd be late.

## **Good Morning? : 10:00**
Still on Cordon Bleu Project. Today I assigned myself to make carousel, can I say custom?. I don't think so.

### Nerd things : 
I was using SiemaJS to make one, because no dependency required off of it, but of course everything is manually made such as carousel indicator dots, arrows and autoplay.
I do some refactoring also in `a-visual-icon`, using `width` and `height` inherit from its parent for dynamic sizing of icon's content, and also I use `background-image` instead of `content`.

By the end of the day, this task was done :).

## **2nd Checkpoint! : 18:00**
