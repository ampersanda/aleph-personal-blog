Hey, It's second day of `Sales Tools - XL Priority Project`

I think I can say that this is the day I start the project. Oh I mean `revised project`.

## `Status: NORMAL`  

## `The Beginning : 09:00`
To be honest, yesterday, I was crying when I afternoon pray after I fix navigation part of it.

I looked at some CSS of off it and it breaks my heart, more like make mine pounding hard. I don't know how to feel. I like CSS so much and I already do it in 3 years.

> I know that maybe my old code is more worse than this, so I'll **`keep positive`** to do it.  

## `The Relief : 18:00`
It's done!. Some refactoring and change most of HTML, its styling code, ~~the jQuery part~~, and add some javascript to it. I hope tomorrow, I'll be better and still positive at most.
