## **Status : Normal**
New office at Apiary Co-working Space. I didn't really know what to expect, but then, yeah, this place is so nice.

## **Start : 09:00**
Missed a day of this project, because I was sick leave in Friday and I was there in Surabaya to fill in a talk for Google Developer Surabaya.
I'm still exhausted, but that's okay, I'll keep up. 

Some tasks in Cordon Bleu project is left behind, because of JavaScript problems and CSS IE9 support are failing.
I did some polyfill and rollback some code to the old version one, like `Array.from()` to old school one `[].slice.call()`.
`Intl` is not supported in IE9, so I create my own formatter for smart tile rolling number animation.
`classList` also has a bad support, so I use the jQuery.

I also did fix `Banner Card` carousel but not yet done. The carousel is replaced but dots and autoplay progress animation is left undone.  

## **End : 18:00**
I intend to keep forward and checking stuff for IE9, because I had no experience enough to satisfy this kind of browser.
