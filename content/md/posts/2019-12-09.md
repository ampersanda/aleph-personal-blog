## **Status : Normal**
Happy birthday to me ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰, hehe. Today I turn myself to 23 years old. 

## **Start : 10:00**
Yesterday, Mr. Fachri told me that I'm going to be assigned to a new project, Astra Mokita. 
They needed help for UI slicing for the React Native mobile app.

Currently I have no task to do yet, because I have a problem with device that I used to develop. I mean the laptop, hehe, but tomorrow would be replaced the new one.
I was so excited!!!!
